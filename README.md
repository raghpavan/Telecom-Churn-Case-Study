## Context

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one,customer retentionhas now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators,retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, we analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

## Assignment

As part of my PG Diploma Data Science course from IIIT Bangalore, India, Telecom Case Study was one of the case studies that I worked on. 

Aim of this case study was to analyse customer-level data, build an interpretable model to identify the main indicators of churn and build 3 high performance models to identify customers at high risk of churn and recommend what model will work best in predicting if customers will churn or not.
